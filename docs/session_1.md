## Why Linux

Linux is almost everywhere!
It powers most of the worldâ€™s biggest servers,
including those run by tech giants like Google and Meta,
and is by far the best choice for cloud computing.
In embedded systems and IoT, Linux is the go-to for most
developers because of its flexibility.
Even in cutting-edge fields like deep learning,
most research papers and projects are built on Linux platforms.

For computer engineers, understanding Linux is fundamental.
In this course, we will focus on learning the basics and
exploring the essential concepts that make Linux such a
powerful and useful tool.
