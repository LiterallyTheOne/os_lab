# Session 2: Basic commands

## User mode 

We can have two modes in a linux
command line:

* `$`: User mode
* `#`: Super user mode

## Command structure

Every command in linux follows a structure,
for example:

```shell
ls -l /etc
```

* `Command`: `ls`
* `Option`: `-l`
  * Options can be more complicated
* `Argument`: `/etc`
